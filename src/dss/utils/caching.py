"""Caching utilities for expensive computations.

This module previously wrapped Streamlit's caching decorators (`st.cache_data`
and `st.cache_resource`) so that expensive functions could be memoised both
inside and outside Streamlit.  In order to simplify the codebase and remove
any reliance on hidden caching mechanisms, the decorators defined here now
behave as identity functions.  That is, they simply return the original
function without applying any caching【372834749795475†L130-L135】.  Removing caching
avoids the need for hashing and makes the implementation easier to
understand for educational purposes.
