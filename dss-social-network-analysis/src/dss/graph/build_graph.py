    Parameters
    ----------
    adjacency: csr_matrix
        A square sparse matrix representing the adjacency weights between
        nodes.  Non‑zero entries indicate edges; diagonal entries are
        ignored.
    directed: bool, optional
        Whether to build a directed graph.  If False (default), an
        undirected graph is built.  Otherwise, a `nx.DiGraph` is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    networkx.Graph
        The resulting graph.  Self loops are removed automatically.
